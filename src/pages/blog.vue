            <p class="mx-40 text-center text-white ">
                The long beloved giant pink cookie is no more. After a interview with former Valve employee
                Erik Wolpaw, who was in the half life snacks video addressed that unfortunately the Giant pink 
                cookie that took him weeks to eat is no longer available to snack on in Valve HQ. This comes as a 
                surprise as the nasty bathroomy trail mix is still available. Wolpaw explained that the giant pink 
                cookie was removed from the snack room because of the new approach to eating healthy in Valve, as many
                Valve employees did not want to be eating the same junk all the time.

                Half-Life 2 was created using Valve's Source engine, which was developed at the same time. Development lasted five years and cost US$40 million. Valve president Gabe Newell set his team the goal of redefining the first-person shooter genre. They integrated the Havok physics engine, which simulates real-world physics, to reinforce the player's sense of presence and create new gameplay, and developed the characterization, with more detailed character models and realistic animation.

Valve announced Half-Life 2 at E3 2003, with a release date for that September; it was delayed by over a year, triggering a backlash. A year before release, an unfinished version of the game was stolen by a hacker and leaked online; the leak damaged team morale and slowed development.

Half-Life 2 was released on Steam on November 16, 2004, and received acclaim. It won 39 Game of the Year awards and has been cited as one of the best games of all time. By 2011, it had sold 12 million copies. Half-Life 2 was followed by the free extra level Lost Coast (2005) and the episodic sequels Episode One (2006) and Episode Two (2007). In 2020, after canceling several further Half-Life projects, Valve released the prequel Half-Life: Alyx.
