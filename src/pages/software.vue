                The Steam Deck was built for extended play sessions—whether you're using thumbsticks or 
                trackpads—with full-size controls positioned perfectly within your reach.
                 The rear of the device is sculpted to comfortably fit a wide range of hand sizes.

               The Source 2006 branch was the term used for Valve's games using technology that culminated
                with the release of Half-Life 2: Episode One. HDR rendering and color correction were first 
                implemented in 2005 using Day of Defeat: Source, which required the engine's shaders to be 
                rewritten. The former, along with developer commentary tracks, were showcased in Half-Life 2:
                Lost Coast. Episode One introduced Phong shading and other smaller features. Image-based 
                rendering technology had been in development for Half-Life 2, but was cut from the engine 
                before its release. It was mentioned again by Gabe Newell in 2006 as a piece of technology he 
                would like to add to Source to implement support for much larger scenes that are impossible 
                with strictly polygonal objects.

               Plans for a successor to the original Source engine began following the release of Half-Life 2: Episode Two in 2007.
               The first engine tech demo was created in 2010 by remaking a map from Left 4 Dead 2. Images of this were leaked onto the internet 
               in early 2014. At the 2014 Game Developers Conference, Valve employee Sergiy Migdalskiy showed off a Source 2 physics debugging tool 
               being used in Left 4 Dead 2. Source 2 was first made available to the public via Steam Workshop tools for Dota 2 in 2014 prior to it 
               being officially announced at the 2015 Game Developers Conference. There, Valve stated their intent for it was to allow for content to 
               be created more efficiently.Valve also stated that it would support the Vulkan graphics API and use a new in-house physics engine 
               called Rubikon, which would replace the need for the third-party Havok tools.
                Gabe Newell, president of Valve, said that the company were prioritizing the development of their own games before they would release the 
                engine and its software development kit to the public as a means of ensuring the highest quality for developers; adding that they were intending 
                to make the engine free to use for game developers as long as the game is published on their Steam service.
